PyQtGraph is a pure-python graphics and GUI library built on PyQt5/PySide2 and
numpy. 

It is intended for use in mathematics / scientific / engineering applications.
Despite being written entirely in python, the library is very fast due to its
heavy leverage of numpy for number crunching, Qt's GraphicsView framework for
2D display, and OpenGL for 3D display.
