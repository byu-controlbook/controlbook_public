For the single link robot arm, use the Matlab \texttt{bode} and \texttt{margin} commands to find the phase and gain margin for the closed loop system under PID control.  On the same graph, plot the open loop Bode plot and the closed loop Bode plot.  What is the bandwidth of the closed loop system, and how does this relate to the crossover frequency?  Use the gains found in HW~\ref{ds:single_link_arm}.\ref{chap:PID-digital-implementation}.
