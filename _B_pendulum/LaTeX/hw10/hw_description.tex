The objective of this problem is to implement the PID controller using only measured outputs of the system.
\begin{description}
\item[(a)]  Modify the system dynamics file so that the parameters $m_1$, $m_2$, $\ell$ and $b$ vary by up to 20\% of their nominal value each time they are run (uncertainty parameter = 0.2).
\item[(b)]  Change the simulation files so that the input to the controller is the output and not the state.  The controller should only assume knowledge of the position $z$ and the angle $\theta$, as well as the reference position $z_r$.
\item[(e)]  Implement the nested PID loops designed in Problems~\ref{ds:pendulum}.\ref{chap:PID-design-specs}.  Use the dirty derivative gain of $\tau=0.05$. Tune the integrator to remove the steady state error caused by the uncertain parameters.
